## Introduction
This Rust application monitors system activity, capturing keystrokes and mouse clicks, and interacts with external configurations. It leverages multiple Rust crates such as `tokio`, `serde_json`, `reqwest`, and others to provide robust functionality.

## Features
- **Keystroke and Mouse Click Monitoring:** Efficiently tracks user input.
- **Periodic Configuration Fetching:** Updates configurations from a remote server at regular intervals.
- **User Status Handling:** Differentiates between paid and unpaid users with appropriate handling.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Utilizes async programming for non-blocking operations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can install Rust using `rustup`:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Clone the Repository
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Shivanshudeveloper/rust_desktop.git
cd rust_desktop
```

### Build the Project
Build the project using Cargo:

```sh
cargo build
```

## Usage

### Running the Application
After building the project, you can run the application with:

```sh
cargo run
```

### Example Output
The application will start monitoring keystrokes and mouse clicks, printing updates to the console. It will also periodically fetch configuration updates from the specified server.

```sh
Keystroke detected, count: 1
Mouse click detected, count: 1
```

### Configuration
The application reads its configuration from a `config.txt` file. Ensure this file is present and properly formatted in the root directory.

```json
{
  "config": {
    "isPaid": true,
    "otherSettings": "value"
  }
}
```
